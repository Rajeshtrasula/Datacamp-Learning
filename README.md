Explore and analyze the students data to see how the length of stay (stay) impacts the average mental health diagnostic scores of the international students present in the study.

Return a table with nine rows and five columns.
The five columns should be aliased as: stay, count_int, average_phq, average_scs, and average_as, in that order.
The average columns should contain the average of the todep (PHQ-9 test), tosc (SCS test), and toas (ASISS test) columns for each length of stay, rounded to two decimal places.
The count_int column should be the number of international students for each length of stay.
Sort the results by the length of stay in descending order.

inter_dom	Types of students (international or domestic)
japanese_cate	Japanese language proficiency
english_cate	English language proficiency
academic	Current academic level (undergraduate or graduate)
age	Current age of student
stay	Current length of stay in years
todep	Total score of depression (PHQ-9 test)
tosc	Total score of social connectedness (SCS test)
toas	Total score of acculturative stress (ASISS test)
